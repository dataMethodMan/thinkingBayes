Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that reflects the certainty of an event.

Degrees of certainty reflect less than certain outcomes. Coin Toss is 50/50

Conditional Probability, is the likelihood of an event happening , with consideration given to some external  influence
denoted as p(A|B)

Conjoint Probability -> two things are true
p(A and B) = p(A)p(B)

Independence, the Probability of one event is not dependent on the proceeding one
p(B|A) = p(B)

Conjunction related to non independence
P(B|A) > p(B)
thus
p(A and B) = p(A)p(B|A)


Cookie Problem
bowlA = (30 , 10)
bowlB  = (20, 20)

p(A|B) != p(B|A)
---
p(B)p(A|B) = p(A)p(B|A)

p(A|B) = p(A)p(B|A)/p(B)
--
thus
p(B_1|V) = (1|2)*(3|4)/(5|8)

Diachronic Interpretation means that something happens over time that affects the hypothesis

Mutually Exclusive: only one of the hypothesis can be true
Collectively Exhaustive: there are no other possibilities
